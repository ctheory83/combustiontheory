I'm Bryan, i'm from Central Florida. I'm currently working to establish myself as a cloud architect, ideally with the AWS platform though i'm also currently studying/working with Azure. 

I've always been a tinkerer by nature and my fascination began with cars. Starting with my classic 1969 Camaro, I ended up working in a speedshop and building high performance street cars, road racers, and dragsters. So many cars, a world record, and a lost colleague sent me off on a different path.

When I decided to return to IT and IT studies, I found myself working with a lot of common, stale environments - Exchange, chunk of storage, Server 2008R2, and likely an IIS/SQL setup someplace. Chasing more, I turned to cloud technologies and virtualization, and i'm using this site to document my work and buildouts.
