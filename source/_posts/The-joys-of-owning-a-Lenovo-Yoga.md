So, i've had the luxury of using a Lenovo Yoga 3 as a daily driver, which outside of very specific virtualization scenarios hosted locally, this machine runs great. I have it dual booting Ubuntu and Windows 10 (prior to Ubuntu, Linux Mint) and have done this for some time, it allows me to easily bounce between environments and work on different projects. I run Hexo, VS Code, Git, and who knows what else under Ubuntu and have done so quite successfully after a Linux Mint upgrade went south. That forced my hand. 

The problem with the Yoga, though, is very specific and infuriating enough. The packaging of the laptop is very tight and thin, and the shells are made of plastic - not terrible, but this allows a mild amount of flex in the laptop. This allows the internal components to touch the case and ground out the unit, locking it up and forcing a hard restart. 

I remedied this for a while by using a piece of an anti-static HDD bag over the wireless adapter, later to be replaced by a bit of tape, and even later, a bit of electric tape. After a short trip out of town with my wife, I came home and fired up the laptop only to find that no wireless connections were available. Not a big deal, especially after I took a few OS updates on my Ubuntu install - i've lost an adapter in this scenario before, I just need to boot from an older kernel.

Reboot, jump on my windows install, and the issue persists. It turns out my minor fixes have finally run out and now i'm chasing a new, long term solution. If you have any suggestions, email me - link is on the site. I'll post more as I fix it.
