Hey guys, I decided that I can't stand WordPress (bloated) and wasn't keen on just aiming my DNS at github pages, so I decided to use hexo, github, and the aws cli to build a flat, fast, and static website to be hosted by AWS in my S3 bucket so I didn't have to fuss with it. I'll even throw a cloudfront distro in front of it, just because i'm feeling festive.
